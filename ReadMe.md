To develop the application or run the app in 'dev' mode:

1. npm install
2. npm run test

After running the 'test' script, the App test should pass, along with any additional tests created during development.

This repository uses a Test Driven Development approach.

3. Add .env file and update the missing credentials.
   The following will be needed:

4. npm run dev

To add a new feature to the repository:

- create a new branch from the 'development' branch.
- prefix the branch name with the next integer in the sequence, with hyphens
  between each word to describe the feature. e.g. '1-init-repo'
- clone the repository locally, or pull the latest version of the repo
- Follow TDD by defining a failing unit test and then developing the minimum code required to pass the test. Continue adding tests and refactoring the developed code until the feature is complete.
- Submit PR to merge feature branch into the development branch. Submit a PR with a guided walkthrough of the code for a Reviewer to use during their asynchronous audit. Respond to the Moderator and Inspector(s) communication as needed.
- At the end of sprint, or when there is a latest stable version of the app, merge
  development into main.
